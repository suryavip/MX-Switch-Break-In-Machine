# Fork notes:
Fork for adjustment to be more suitable to be built with parts found from Indonesian marketplace. **This fork is still in progress and all parts are not proven to be compatible yet.** Please check the [original repo](https://github.com/keekeen/MX-Switch-Break-In-Machine/).

# MX Switch Break-In Machine
A simple machine designed to actuate/ break-in MX style switches consistently and repetitively for a smoother push feel. Watch the [assembly process and operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYIlCdo38ZM&list=PLLd9RKaLkD3lO_kQBJ3w394Xko4Nm3RR9) of the machine here.

- Compatibility: 
  -  MX style switches with total travel distance of 4mm
  -  MX style switches with total travel distance less than 4mm (tweaks required for this)

## Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- The provided files are to be used at your own risk.
- The dimensional tolerances may vary between 3D printers. See acceptable tolerances under [`Production/Technical-Drawings`](/Production/Technical-Drawings).
- The complete units showed in pictures and videos shared in this repo were printed with [JLCPCB 3D printing service](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote), with material of 8000 Resin, and remarked to print at an 30/45 angle for better Z-axis accuracy.
- Do ensure to run the machine at a ventilated area or fan-cooled to prevent the motor from overheating.
